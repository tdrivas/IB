This project aims at introducing the fundamentals of pseudocode and JAVA programming at the 
students in the last 2 years of high school.

However, after this introduction, the project goes deeper into the computational thinking 
opening the room to the development of problem-solving skills.

Last but not least, it presents the natural and pragmatic approach of object-oriented programming in a 
friendly way so the students to have the full understanding and the advantages of it's usage.

#### What is PseudoCode 
Pseudocode considered to be a simplified way to describe a solution for a problem without the need of writing code in full (So avoid techinal limitations of a programming language).

The writing pseudocode leads to: 
1. Critically thinking by breaking the problem into chunks (sub-problems)
2. Easiness of undestanding the solution by others.
3. Revealing a series of features that are going to be also included in the actual code. 

The more complex a problem is, the most helpful is the usage of the pseudocode!
